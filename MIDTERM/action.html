<h2>In terms of mental health, what is SELF-HELP?</h2></br>
<p>
&emsp;Self-help therapies are psychological treatments that you can conduct at home to help with issues such as stress, anxiety, and depression. They can be a good tool to check if a therapy, such as cognitive-behavioral therapy (CBT), is right for you. They are also useful if you are short on time.
</br></br></p>
<p>
	&emsp; Make an effort to be aware of your feelings. Accept that you are experiencing negative emotions, allow yourself to feel them, and then take steps to alleviate them. You have no control over whether or not you have a mental illness, but you do have power over how you react to your symptoms.
</br></br>
</p>
 <p>
	 &emsp; Consider engaging in a relaxing activity. Look into calm or wellness programs or applications that include things like meditation, muscular relaxation, and breathing exercises. Make time for these and other healthful activities you enjoy, such as writing, regularly.
Prioritize and set goals.</br></br></p>

<p>
	&emsp;The concept of self-help cultivates a variety of positive traits in a person.
These people put in more effort than someone who relies on others to do their work. As a result, they will be able to develop strong willpower and resolve. A self-reliant person develops self-confidence.

<h2>SUPPORT GROUP: Valuable Step Toward Healing</h2></br>
<p> &emsp; Whether you're looking for help with caregiving, addiction, depression, anxiety, or another mental health condition, getting out of your comfort zone and joining a support group can be a helpful step toward recovery.</p></br>
<p>&emsp; Support groups were formed to bring individuals together who are going through similar difficult times. Coping with a specific medical illness, such as cancer or dementia, a mental health issue, such as depression, anxiety, grief, or addiction, or caring for a family member or friend who is dealing with such a problem. Whatever problems you or a loved one are facing, the voice of those who have walked in your shoes may often be the finest medicine.</p></br>
<p>&emsp; A support group provides a secure environment in which to obtain knowledge that is practical, constructive, and beneficial. You will gain from encouragement, and you will learn more about coping with your challenges as a result of shared experiences. Hearing from people who are going through similar experiences might help you feel less alone in your struggles.</p></br></div>
