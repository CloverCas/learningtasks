<p>
	&emsp; &emsp; Cultures, values, and traditions may have a different understanding of what constitutes good mental health. It influences how people display symptoms, express these symptoms, deal with psychological issues, and decide whether or not to seek treatment. Because of these differences, evaluating the various attitudes of mentally healthy people toward mental health may be the greatest method to expand our understanding of it. Further knowledge of mental health is important since it has a large impact on the economy, as economies appear to be critically dependent on the population's mental health.</br></br>

	&emsp; &emsp; Good mental health is important for economic growth. Filipinos' cultural ideas differ in almost every way. One common misperception is that sadness and anxiety do not exist and that mental diseases are something to be ashamed of. According to a qualitative study, this stigma is thought to be an effect of public belief about mental disorders, which includes three themes.</br></br>

	&emsp; &emsp; The first is familial problems, in which the family rejects or disowns the family member who suffers from a mental disorder because they believe it can be inherited.</br></br>

	&emsp; &emsp; The second is unrealistic pessimism and optimism about the severity of the condition, in which the mentally sick either suffer from substantial functional impairment or are capable of overcoming any psychological pain on their own.</br></br>

	&emsp; &emsp; Finally, there is the oversimplified chronic course, in which individuals who do not have mental diseases apply an acute illness paradigm to those who are ill and expect full recovery in the near term.</br></br>

	&emsp; &emsp; Because of this stigma, the Philippine government and public sectors have paid minimal attention to mental health. Although the country just approved its first Mental Health Act and Universal Health Care Law, barely 5% of healthcare expenditure is allocated toward mental health. There are also just 7.76 hospital beds and 0.41 psychiatrists for every 100,000 people. The Philippine government does not even offer financial assistance to groups involved in the development and implementation of mental health policies and regulations. Consequently, mental illness has risen to become the third most common disability in the Philippines, with six million Filipinos suffering from depression and anxiety. As a result, the country has the Western Pacific's third-highest rate of mental illnesses.</br></br>

	&emsp; &emsp; Furthermore, the Philippine World Health Organization (WHO) Special Initiative for Mental Health, which was done in 2020, revealed that 3.6 million Filipinos had at least one type of mental, neurological, or drug use illness. Suicide rates are stated to be 3.2 per 100,000 people, with males having a greater rate than females. However, these figures may be underreported since suicides are occasionally misclassified as "undetermined fatalities." According to the WHO, 154 million Filipinos suffer from depression, 1 million from schizophrenia, and 15.3 million from drug use disorders each year, while 877,000 die by suicide. Thus, mental problems may have a significant impact on employment and educational attainment, particularly among people aged 25 to 52.</br></br></p>
